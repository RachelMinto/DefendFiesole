# DefendFiesole
A Plants Vs Zombies type game

Notes for asset creation for future:
For background, it's a 1920x1080 play zone with a safe space of 1440x1080.
The grid will be 9x5 160x160 squares.

This game was a learning piece for me. 

It has an options panel where the user can control difficulty (affects # starting lives) and volume. 
Some sound effects and visual effects for scene load and defender death respectively.
Includes a loading Splash Screen as well as the option to retry the level. 

If I were to continue developing this game, I'd add various levels of graduated difficulty to introduce new concepts to the player. I'd also not highlight a Defender to place until the player has enough stars to buy the Defender, providing a visual cue for what's available. Finally, I'd add in some more Defender/Attacker options and have the ealier levels provide visual cues for a more limited set of lanes that attackers could come in on, and increase the speed of spawned defenders as levels progress.
